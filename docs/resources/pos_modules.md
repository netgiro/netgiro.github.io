## POS modules

If you need to create your own POS integration for systems running on Windows you can use our .NET POS module. It's quite convenient method for fast and secure integration. The whole payment workflow is at hand with few lines of code in your system. See the .NET POS module documentation for more info. We also have a module written in Delphi available. 
<b>For any specific detail and further technical instructions about POS integration, please contact our developers at dev[at]netgiro.is.</b>
