# Migrating from current to new payments integration

Current HPSDK merchants will have to migrate their Netgíró alternative payment method from the HPSDK (Hosted Payment SDK) integration to the new payments integration by 2022-July-31.

- Follow the steps for [new installation](/docs/web-shop-plugins/shopify/new-merchants)
- In Shopify store admin (under Settings->Payments), deactivate your current Netgíró alternative payment method.  **Do not delete the current Netgíró alternative payment method or remove the Netgíró ApplicationId and Secret Key** until all previous HPSDK order are finalized.
